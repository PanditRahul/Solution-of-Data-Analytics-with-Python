Given a list of tuples, write a Python program to sort the tuples by the second item of each tuple.
Given:
4
a 23
b 37
c 11
d 29
The first line of input is the number of tuples in the list. All other lines are tuples having the first element as a string and the second element as an integer.

Expected output:
[('c', 11), ('a', 23), ('d', 29), ('b', 37)]



Solution



# Read input as sepcified in the question
# Print output as specified in the question
tuple = [('c', 11), ('a', 23), ('d', 29), ('b', 37)]
Len = len(tuple)
for i in range(0, Len):
    for j in range(0, (Len - i - 1)):
        if(tuple[j][1] > tuple[j+1][1]):
            temp = tuple[j]
            tuple[j] = tuple[j+1]
            tuple[j+1] = temp
print(str(tuple))
