Read the sklearn dataset

scikit-learn comes with a few small standard datasets that do not require downloading any file from some external website.
These datasets are useful to quickly illustrate the behaviour of the various algorithms implemented in scikit-learn. They are however often too small to be representative of real-world machine learning tasks.
One such dataset is the "Iris dataset".
Your work is to load this dataset from the sklearn library and print the first five rows using the head method of the pandas' library.
Output
Print the first 5 rows of iris dataset(after loading from sklearn toy dataset).



Solution


## Open and read data file as specified in the question
## Print the required output in given format

from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
import pandas as pd

iris = load_iris()


iris_df = pd.DataFrame(data=iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)


print(iris_df.head())
