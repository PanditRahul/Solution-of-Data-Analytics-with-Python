Split the dataset
Send Feedback
In the previous problem we loaded the iris dataset. Now use this loaded dataset to split the training and testing dataset.
Your work is to again load this dataset from the sklearn library and split the dataset into training and testing in the ratio of 70:30 and print the shape.
Output
Print the shape of X_train
Print the shape of X_test
Print the shape of y_train
Print the shape of y_test


Solution


import pandas as pd 
from sklearn import datasets 
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
iris = datasets.load_iris() 
X = iris.data
y = iris.target 
iris_df = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=iris.feature_names) 
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris_df, y, test_size=0.3)
print(X_train.shape) 
print(X_test.shape) 
print(y_train.shape)
print(y_test.shape)
