Second Largest
Send Feedback
You have been given a random integer array/list(ARR) of size N. You are required to find and return the second largest element present in the array/list.
If N <= 1 or all the elements are same in the array/list then return -2147483648 or -2 ^ 31(It is the smallest value for the range of Integer)
Input format :
The first line of input contains an integer 'N' representing the size of the array/list.

The following lines contain 'N' single newline separated integers representing the elements in the array/list.
Output Format :
Print the second largest in the array/list if exists, -2147483648 otherwise.
Constraints :
0 <= N <= 10^5

Time Limit: 1 sec

Solution



# Write your code here
def secondLargestElement(arr, n):
    if n <= 1:
        return -2147483648

    largest = arr[0]
    secondLargest = -2147483648

    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > largest:
            secondLargest = largest
            largest = arr[i]
        elif arr[i] > secondLargest and arr[i] != largest:
            secondLargest = arr[i]

    if secondLargest == -2147483648:
        return -2147483648
    else:
        return secondLargest


n = int(input())
arr = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
print(secondLargestElement(arr, n))
