Replace missing values
Send Feedback
Given File 'olympics.csv'
Problem Statement:
In previous question you handled the missing values for the columns ["Height", "Weight", "notes", "region"].
Still there are missing values present in the "Medal" column. Now you don't need to drop the values present in this column because Medals have a NaN in about 2,31,333 rows. These can be explained since not all participating athletes would win medals.
Let's replace these missing values with 'DNW'. DNW means Did not win.
For the output print the unique number of values present in the Medal column.
Output Format:
DNW       230972
Gold       13371
Bronze     13291
...


Solution


## Open and read data file as specified in the question
## Print the required output in given format

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

olympics = pd.read_csv('olympics.csv')

#####################################
olympics.drop(columns=["notes", "Height", "Weight"], inplace=True)

olympics = olympics[pd.notnull(olympics['region'])]
#####################################

##############################
#### Start code from here ####
##############################
olympics["Medal"] = olympics["Medal"].fillna("DNW")


print(olympics["Medal"].value_counts())
