Handling Missing Values
Send Feedback
Given File 'olympics.csv'

Problem Statement:
In the previous column you analyzed the columns that contain any missing values.
You found out that Age, Height, Weight, Medal, region and notes columns contain null values.
Now you need to handle these missing values.
For the columns "Height, Weight and notes", you are going to drop these columns as they are not required in our further analysis.
For the "region" column, remove all the rows where the region column is having null values.
For output print the shape of the dataset after performing these operations.
Note: You are going to handle the Medal and Age column in the next questions.
Output Format:
print the shape of the dataset after performing the missing value handling operations.
