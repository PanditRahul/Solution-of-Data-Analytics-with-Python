# ## Open and read data file as specified in the question
# ## Print the required output in given format
# import statistics

# import numpy as np # linear algebra
# import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# olympics = pd.read_csv('olympics_cleaned.csv')
# olympics_shooting = olympics[olympics['Sport'] == 'Shooting']


# age_mean = olympics_shooting['Age'].mean()
# age_std = olympics_shooting['Age'].std()
# olympics_shooting['Age_std'] = (olympics_shooting['Age'] - age_mean) / age_std


# age_std_mean = olympics_shooting['Age_std'].mean()
# age_std_std = olympics_shooting['Age_std'].std()

# print(round(age_std_mean, 2))
# print(round(age_std_std, 2))
