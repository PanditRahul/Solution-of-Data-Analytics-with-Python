Solution



# import numpy as np # linear algebra
# import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# olympics = pd.read_csv('olympics_cleaned.csv')

# num_cities = olympics['City'].nunique()
# print("Number of cities where Olympics have been held so far:", num_cities)


# city_counts = olympics['City'].value_counts()
# city_counts.plot(kind='bar')
# plt.xlabel('City')
# plt.ylabel('Number of times hosted')
# plt.title('Number of times cities hosted the Olympics')
# plt.show()
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
olympics = pd.read_csv("olympics_cleaned.csv")
df = olympics.copy()
count = 0
for i in df.City.unique():
    count += 1
print(count)
city = np.array(df.City)
plt.hist(city, bins = 42, edgecolor = 'black')
plt.xticks(rotation = 90)
# plt.figure(figsize=(15,8))
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [15, 8]
plt.show()
