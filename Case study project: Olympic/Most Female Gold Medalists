# import numpy as np # linear algebra
# import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# olympics = pd.read_csv('olympics_cleaned.csv')

# hosting_uk = olympics[olympics['City'] == 'London']


# std_hosting_uk = hosting_uk['Gold'].std()


# not_hosting_uk = olympics[olympics['City'] != 'London']

# std_not_hosting_uk = not_hosting_uk['Gold'].std()


# print('Standard Deviation when hosting:', std_hosting_uk)
# print('Standard Deviation when not hosting:', std_not_hosting_uk)
