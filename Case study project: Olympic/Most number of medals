# import numpy as np # linear algebra
# import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# olympics = pd.read_csv('olympics_cleaned.csv')

# gold = olympics[olympics['Medal'] == 'Gold']

# data = []
# for sport in gold['Sport'].unique():
#     data.append([sport, len(gold[gold['Sport'] == sport])])

# data = pd.DataFrame(data, columns = ['Sport', 'Gold']).sort_values(by='Gold', ascending = False).head()
# data.plot(x='Sport', y='Gold', kind='bar', figsize=(10,5))
import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

olympics = pd.read_csv('olympics_cleaned.csv')
df = olympics.copy()
df = df[df['Medal'] != 'DNW']
df = df.groupby(df['Sport']).size().reset_index(name='count').sort_values('count', ascending=False)
sport_list = df['Sport'][0:5]
medal_count_list = df['count'][0:5]

plt.bar(sport_list, medal_count_list)
plt.show()
l = np.array(df['Sport'][0:5])
print(l[0])
