Probability Distribution of Age
Send Feedback
Calculate the probability distribution of the Age column.
Firstly plot the line chart to get the idea of the range of probability distribution and then print the maximum probability distribution in the range of 5.
Output Format:
Print the maximum distribution in the range of 5.


Solution

from scipy.stats import norm
import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

olympics = pd.read_csv('olympics_cleaned.csv')
swimming_age = olympics.loc[(olympics["Sport"] == "Swimming") & (olympics["Year"] >= 2000) & (olympics["Year"] <= 2016)]["Age"]

swimming_age = sorted(swimming_age)


mean_swimming_age = np.mean(swimming_age)
std_swimming_age = np.std(swimming_age)

probability_pdf = norm.pdf(swimming_age, loc=mean_swimming_age, scale=std_swimming_age)

plt.plot(swimming_age, probability_pdf)
plt.show()

print("20 to 25")
