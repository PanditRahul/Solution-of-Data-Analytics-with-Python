Given File 'titanic.csv'
Problem Statement:
From the dataset, find out if there is a significant difference in the mean sex between the passenger who survived and the passenger who did not survive?.
In the dataset,
For Survived = 0 means the passenger has not survived.

For Survived = 1 means the passenger has survived.
Output Format:
Print "Yes" if there is a significant difference otherwise print "No".
Here for significant difference, the mean should vary by 2 points at least.


Solution



## Open and read data file as specified in the question
## Print the required output in given format

import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

df = pd.read_csv('titanic.csv')

mean_sex_survived = df[df['Survived'] == 1]['Sex'].mean()
mean_sex_not_survived = df[df['Survived'] == 0]['Sex'].mean()

t_stat, p_value = ttest_ind(df[df['Survived'] == 1]['Sex'], df[df['Survived'] == 0]['Sex'])

if abs(mean_sex_survived - mean_sex_not_survived) >= 2 and p_value < 0.05:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
