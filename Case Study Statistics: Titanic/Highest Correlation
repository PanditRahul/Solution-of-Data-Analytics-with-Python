import pandas as pd


df = pd.read_csv('titanic.csv')

corr_matrix = df.corr()
corr_values = corr_matrix['Survived'].abs().sort_values(ascending=False)
highest_corr_column = corr_values.index[1]  # Exclude the "Survived" column itself

print(highest_corr_column)
print('{:.2f}'.format(corr_values[1]))
