For Survived = 1 means the passenger has survived.

For Sex = 1 means the passenger is male.

For Sex = 0 means the passenger is Female.
Output Format:
Print the percentages rounded off to two decimal places in separate lines.


Solution


## Open and read data file as specified in the question
## Print the required output in given format

import pandas as pd

titanic = pd.read_csv('titanic.csv')

total_passengers = titanic.shape[0]

survived = titanic[titanic['Survived'] == 1].shape[0]

percentage_survived = (survived / total_passengers) * 100

male_survived = titanic[(titanic['Survived'] == 1) & (titanic['Sex'] == 1)].shape[0]
percentage_male_survived = (male_survived / survived) * 100

female_survived = titanic[(titanic['Survived'] == 1) & (titanic['Sex'] == 0)].shape[0]
percentage_female_survived = (female_survived / survived) * 100

print('{:.2f}'.format(percentage_survived))
print('{:.2f}'.format(percentage_male_survived))
print('{:.2f}'.format(percentage_female_survived))
