Write a program to print first x terms of the series 3N + 2 which are not multiples of 4.
Input format :
Integer x
Output format :
Terms of series (separated by space)
Constraints :## Read input as specified in the question.
## Print output as specified in the question.
n = int(input())

count = 1
current = 1

while(count <= n):
    num = 3 * current + 2

    if num % 4 != 0:
        print(num, end=" ")
        count += 1

    current +=1
1 <= x <= 1,000


Solution


## Read input as specified in the question.
## Print output as specified in the question.
n = int(input())

count = 1
current = 1

while(count <= n):
    num = 3 * current + 2

    if num % 4 != 0:
        print(num, end=" ")
        count += 1

    current +=1
