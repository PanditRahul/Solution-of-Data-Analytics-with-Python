You have been provided with an integer value as input. Your task is to print "Fizz" and "Buzz" according to the below conditions.

1. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number.

2. For the multiples of five print "Buzz". 

3. For numbers that are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 100
Expected Output
 Print the output separated by the space.
Example 1:
Input: n = 3
Output: "1","2","Fizz"
Example 2:
Input: n = 5
Output: "1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"
Example 3:
Input: n = 15
Output: "1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11"


Solution:


# Read input as sepcified in the question
# Print output as specified in the question
n = int(input())
out = [ ]
for i in range(1, n):
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5== 0:
        out.append("fizzbuzz")
        continue
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        out.append("fizz")
        continue
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        out.append("buzz")
        continue
    out.append(i)

print(out)
