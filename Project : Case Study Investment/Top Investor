import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("startup_funding.csv")
df['InvestorsName'].dropna(inplace=True)

    d = {}
    for i in array:
        if ',' not in i:
            d[i] = d.get(i,0) + 1
        else:
            string = i.strip().split(',')
            for j in string:
                d[j.strip()] = d.get(j.strip(),0) + 1
    return d
