Given File 'startup_funding.csv'
Problem Statement :
Check the trend of investments over the years. To check the trend, find -
Total number of fundings done in each year.
Plot a line graph between year and number of fundings. Take year on x-axis and number of fundings on y-axis.
Print year-wise total number of fundings also. Print years in ascending order.
Note :
There is some error in the 'Date' feature. Make sure to handle that.
Output Format :
year1 TotalFunding1
year2 TotalFunding2

Solution

# Open and read data file as specified in the question
# Print the required output in given format
import csv
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import collections
with open('startup_funding.csv', encoding ='UTF-8') as file_obj:
    file_data = csv.DictReader(file_obj, skipinitialspace=True)

    dct = {}
    for row in file_data:
        year = row['Date'][-4:]
        if year in dct:
            dct[year] += 1
        else:
            dct[year] = 1
            
    ord_dct = collections.OrderedDict(sorted(dct.items()))                                  
    plt.plot(list(ord_dct.keys()),list(ord_dct.values()))
    plt.xlabel("Year")
    plt.ylabel("Number of Fundings")
    plt.title('Year VS "Number of Fundings"')
    plt.show()
    
    for i in ord_dct.keys():
        print(i,end=" ")
        print(ord_dct[i])
