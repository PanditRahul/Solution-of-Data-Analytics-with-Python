As the Ace residency society supervisor, you want to impose some set of rules. To impose those rules you need to have a better understanding of the people who are living there. This understanding needs to be in the numbers. We are providing you with the age of the people who are living in the society.
[24, 43, 41, 33, 25, 19, 17, 9, 50, 34, 55, 2, 25, 21]
In this task, you need to calculate the IQR (Inter-Quartile Range).
The formula for IQR is
The difference between the third quartile Q3(75th percentiles) and the first quartile Q1(25th percentiles) is called the Interquartile range.

IQR = Q3 âˆ’  Q1

where

Q1 is the first quartile
Q3 is the third quartile
Output Format
The output should be in the form of integer format.

IQR Value
Note: please refer to the notes.(Use NumPy library)


Solution

## Open and read data file as specified in the question
## Print the required output in given format
import numpy as np 
arr = [24, 43, 41, 33, 25, 19, 17, 9, 50, 34, 55, 2, 25, 21] # calculate interquartile range 
q3, q1 = np.percentile(arr, [75, 25])
iqr = q3 - q1 # display interquartile range 
print(int(iqr))
