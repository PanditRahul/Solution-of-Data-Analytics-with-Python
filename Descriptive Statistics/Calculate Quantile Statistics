As the Ace residency society supervisor, you want to impose some set of rules. To impose those rules you need to have a better understanding of the people who are living there. This understanding needs to be in the numbers. We are providing you with the age of the people who are living in the society.
[24, 43, 41, 33, 25, 19, 17, 9, 50, 34, 55, 2, 25, 21]
In this task, you need to find the quantiles [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1] of this dataset.
You need to print 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1st quantile.
Output Format
The output should be in the form of integer format.

0th quantile value
25th quantile value
50th quantile value
75th quantile value
100th quantile value

Note: please refer to the notes.(use NumPy library)


Solution


## Open and read data file as specified in the question
## Print the required output in given format
import numpy as np

data = [24, 43, 41, 33, 25, 19, 17, 9, 50, 34, 55, 2, 25, 21]

quantiles = np.quantile(data, [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1])

print(int(quantiles[0]))  # 0th quantile value
print(int(quantiles[1]))  # 25th quantile value
print(int(quantiles[2]))  # 50th quantile value
print(int(quantiles[3]))  # 75th quantile value
print(int(quantiles[4]))  # 100th quantile value
