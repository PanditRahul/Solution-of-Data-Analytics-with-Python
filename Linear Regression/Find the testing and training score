Find the testing and training score
Send Feedback
For the given dataset "FuelEconomy.csv"
Create a Linear Regressor and fit the dataset in this and then print the training and testing score for this regressor.
Note: Inside the function "traintestsplit" use the "random_state = 42".
To know more about randomstate please read the document given regarding randomstate.
Output
Print the testing and training scores in separate lines rounded off to 3 decimal places.




Solution


## Open and read data file as specified in the question
## Print the required output in given format
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

fuelEconomy = np.loadtxt('FuelEconomy.csv', delimiter=',')

X = fuelEconomy[:, 0].reshape(-1, 1)
y = fuelEconomy[:, 1]

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

regressor = LinearRegression()
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

test_score = regressor.score(X_test, y_test)
train_score = regressor.score(X_train, y_train)

print(round(test_score, 3))
print(round(train_score, 3))


#print(round(regressor.score(X_train, y_train), 3))
#print(round(regressor.score(X_test, y_test), 3))
