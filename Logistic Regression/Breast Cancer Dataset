Solution


## Open and read data file as specified in the question
## Print the required output in given format
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn import model_selection
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

cancer_ds = datasets.load_breast_cancer()
X = cancer_ds.data
Y = cancer_ds.target

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = model_selection.train_test_split(X,Y,test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

clf = LogisticRegression(C=2, solver = 'liblinear')
clf.fit(X_train, Y_train)

print(round(clf.score(X_train, Y_train), 2))
print(round(clf.score(X_test, Y_test), 2))
