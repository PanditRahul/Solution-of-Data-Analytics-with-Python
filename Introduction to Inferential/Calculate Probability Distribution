An experiment has been conducted in which a die is rolled 10 times. Your task is to find the probability mass function for getting the number "3" for a total of "4" times.
Note
The probability of success for 3 is 1/6 = 0.16.
Expected Output
Print the pmf rounded off to 2 decimal places.
(Please refer to the Probability Distribution in Python Notes)


Solution

from scipy.stats import binom

calc_pmf = binom.pmf(k=3, n=10, p=0.16)

n = 10 # number of trials
p = 1/6 # probability of success (rolling a 3)
k = 4 # number of successes we want

pmf = binom.pmf(k, n, p)

print(round(calc_pmf, 2))
