You have been given a list
[6, 7, 7, 12, 13, 13, 15, 16, 19, 22].
Calculate the z-score for this list. And round off each value to 1 decimal place.
(Please refer the notes)
Output Format
Print the z score values for each element rounded off to 1 decimal place in the form of a list. 


Solution


## Open and read data file as specified in the question
## Print the required output in given format
data = [6, 7, 7, 12, 13, 13, 15, 16, 19, 22]

# calculate mean and standard deviation
mean = sum(data) / len(data)
std_dev = (sum((x - mean)**2 for x in data) / len(data))**0.5

# calculate z-scores
z_scores = [(x - mean) / std_dev for x in data]

# print z-scores rounded to 1 decimal place
print([round(x, 1) for x in z_scores])
