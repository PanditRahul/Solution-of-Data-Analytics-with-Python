Problem Statement
Write a python script which takes integer input from the user and checks if the number is divisible by 2 and 3 or not.
Input Format
Integer n
Expected Output


1. If the number is divisible by 2 and 3, then print:
“Divisible by 2 and 3”.
2. If the number is divisible by 2 but not by 3, then print:
“Divisible by 2 but not divisible by 3”.
3. If the number is divisible by 3 but not by 2, then print:
“Divisible by 3 but not divisible by 2”.
4. If the number is not divisible by 3 and also not by 2, then print:
“Not Divisible by 2 and also not divisible by 3”.


Solutions:


num = int(input())

if num % 2== 0:
    if num % 3 == 0:
        print("Divisible by 2 and 3")
    else:
        print("Divisible by 2 but not divisible by 3")
else:
    if num % 3 == 0:
        print("Divisible by 3 but not divisible by 2")
    else:
        print("Not Divisible by 2 and also not divisible by 3")
