Now, our task is to take input from the user and perform some operations on them.
We need to find simple interest. For this, we need to take input from the user:
P, the principal amount
T, the time and
R, the rate
The formula for Simple Interest = (P x T x R)/100
Hint: We need to convert the input into integer form using the int() function.
Note: Output should also be in the integer format.





 Solution :
 
 
 
 
 # Read input as sepcified in the question
# Print output as specified in the question
P = int(input())
R = int(input())
T = int(input())
simpleInterest = (P*T*R)/100
print(int(simpleInterest))
