Send Feedback
Given an integer array A of size n. Find and print all the leaders present in the input array. An array element A[i] is called Leader, if all the elements following it (i.e. present at its right) are less than or equal to A[i].
Print all the leader elements separated by space and in the same order they are present in the input array.
Input Format :
Line 1 : Integer n, size of array
Line 2 : Array A elements (separated by space)

Solution


## Read input as specified in the question.
## Print output as specified in the question.

n = int(input())
arr = [int(ele) for  ele in input().split()]

curr_max = arr[n-1]
ans = [arr[n-1]]
for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
    if arr[i] >= curr_max:
        ans.append(arr[i])
        curr_max = arr[i]
for i in range (len(ans)-1, -1, -1):
    print(ans[i], end = ' ')
