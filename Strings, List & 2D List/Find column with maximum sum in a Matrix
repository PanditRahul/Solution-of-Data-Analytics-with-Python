Given an N*N matrix. The task is to find the index of the column with the maximum sum. That is the column whose sum of elements is maximum.
Input Format
N
N*N matrix in comma separated form for each row.
Input :

    5
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    5, 3, 1, 4, 2
    5, 6, 7, 8, 9
    0, 6, 3, 4, 12
    9, 7, 12, 4, 3
Output: Column 5 has the max sum of 31.

Input :

    3
    1, 2, 3
    4, 2, 1
    5, 6, 7
Output: Column 3 has the max sum of 11.


Solution

# Read input as sepcified in the question
# Print output as specified in the question

N = int(input())
rows = N
columns = N

matrix = []

for _ in range(rows):
    row = list(map(int, input().split(',')))
    matrix.append(row)

max_sum = float('-inf')

for i in range(columns):
    row_sum = 0
    for j in range(rows):
        row_sum+= matrix[j][i]

    max_sum = max(row_sum, max_sum)
print(max_sum)
