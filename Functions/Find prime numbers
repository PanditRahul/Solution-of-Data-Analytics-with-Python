Find prime numbers
Send Feedback
You are given a positive integer ‘N’. Your task is to print all prime numbers less than or equal to N.
Note: A prime number is a natural number that is divisible only by 1 and itself. Example - 2, 3, 17, etc.
You can assume that the value of N will always be greater than 1. So, the answer will always exist.

Input Format:
The input contains a single positive integer ‘N’.
Output Format :
Print single space-separated prime numbers less than or equal to ‘N’ in increasing order.


Solution


## Read input as specified in the question.
## Print output as specified in the question.

import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(10**7)


def primeNumberTillN(N):

        prime = []
        for Number in range (1, N + 1):
            count = 0
            for i in range(2, (Number//2 + 1)):
                if(Number % i == 0):
                    count = count + 1
                    break

            if (count == 0 and Number != 1):
                prime.append(Number)

        return prime
        

def takeInput() :
    n = int(input().strip())
    return n

def printAns(ans):
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end = ' ')

n = takeInput()
ans = primeNumberTillN(n)
printAns(ans)
