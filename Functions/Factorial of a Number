Factorial of a Number
Send Feedback
You are given an integer ‘N’. You have to print the value of Factorial of ‘N’. The Factorial of a number ‘N’ is defined as the product of all numbers from 1 to ‘N’.
For Example:
Consider if ‘N’ = 4, the Factorial of 4 will be the product of all numbers from 1 to 4, which is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24. Hence, the answer is 24.
Input Format:
The test case contains one single integer ‘N’ representing the given integer.
Output Format:
Print the value of the factorial of ‘N’.


Solution


## Read input as specified in the question.
## Print output as specified in the question.
def factorial(x):

    if x == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return(x * factorial(x-1))

num = int(input())
print(factorial(num))
