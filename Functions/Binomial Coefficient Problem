Binomial Coefficient Problem
Send Feedback
A Ninja was learning how to calculate the binomial coefficient. But, learning that alone won’t help the ninja since a lot of problems are required to be solved as homework. Since the ninja is old-fashioned and doesn’t know that a computer can do the same homework in a matter of a few seconds you will have to help with the problems.
You need to complete a function for the ninja that can calculate the binomial of a number where when given two integers 'N' and 'R', the program can calculate its respective binomial coefficient nCr. Since the answer may be very large, calculate the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
For Example:
Input: 'N' = 5, 'R' = 2
Output: 10

The value of 5C2 is 10
Input Format
N R space separated in one line
Output Format
nCr value

from math import *

## Read input as specified in the question.
## Print output as specified in the question.
from math import factorial as fact

def binomial(a,b):
    return fact(a) // fact(b) // fact(a-b)

a, b = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(binomial(a, b))
