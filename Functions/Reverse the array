Reverse the array
Send Feedback
Given an array with N elements, the task is to reverse all the array elements and print the reversed array.
Input Format:
The first line contains an integer N representing the size of the array.

The second line contains N space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.
Output Format:
The only line of the output prints N space-separated integers representing the Reversed array elements.
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^3
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9
1 <= K < N
Sample Input:
8
7 5 2 11 2 43 1 10
Sample Output:
10 1 43 2 11 2 5 7
Explanation of Sample Input:
Here the elements have been reversed.



Solution





#Your code goes here.
def reverseArray(arr,start,end,length):

    while start < end:

        arr[start],arr[end] = arr[end],arr[start]
        start += 1
        end -= 1


length = int(input())
arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

reverseArray(arr,0,length - 1, length)
print(*arr)
