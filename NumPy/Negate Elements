Problem Statemnt:
Given a 1D array, negate all elements which are between 3 and 8 (both inclusive)?
Note: Generate the following array
array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
Print the Numpy array.
Output Format :
firstElement 
secondElement  
... 


## Open and read data file as specified in the question
## Print the required output in given format
import numpy as np
arr = np.arange(1,11)
arr[2:8] = np.multiply(arr[2:8],-1)
for i in arr:
    print(i)
