Implementation of KNN using Sklearn
Send Feedback
For the sklearn toy dataset "Breast Cancer", you need to perform KNN on this dataset using Sklearn.
Note: Use "random_state=42"
Output
Testing score rounded to 2 decimal places


\
Solution


## Open and read data file as specified in the question
## Print the required output in given format

from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# Load the dataset
data = load_breast_cancer()

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.data, data.target, random_state=42)

# Create a KNN classifier with k=5
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)

# Fit the classifier to the training data
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Calculate the testing score
score = knn.score(X_test, y_test)

# Print the testing score rounded to 2 decimal places
print(round(score, 2))
